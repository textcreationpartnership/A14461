            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE loue of God our Father, and the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to you, and multiplyed from day to day, thorowe the communion of the holy Ghoſt. There is an auncient Poet which ſaith, that he which dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and profiteth altogether in his writings, hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the price and fauour towardes all men. The ſame is ſpoken bicauſe of the diuerſitie of natures. It is very true, that the onely doctrine, wherein we knowe it to be good and profitable, ought to ſuffice vs, for to incitate and prouoke vs to reade willingly a booke, to giue and beſtowe thereon all our ſtudie, to loue and ſet by it, and finally to take pleaſure in it. But there are a great many, and well neere the moſt parte, which will be a greate deale better pleaſed, that one ſhould teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a gentle &amp; pleaſant faſhion, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: In ſuch ſort, that as in recreating themſelues, they may profite &amp; receiue inſtruction, liuen then as thoſe which occupie themſelues to make bookes of paſtime, vaine and friuolous, &amp; which cauſe the world to reade them, are to bee vituperated and deſpiſed although they haue no corruption in them: So on the other ſide, thoſe which haue the grace, ſo to teach that they doe both delight and profite the Readers thorowe their pleaſant ſtile, are double to be prayſed. And in very deede that is a vertue &amp; a gift which is not in al men.
<pb facs="tcp:19820:4"/> Yea, often times the wiſeſt cannot atteine vnto it. And which is more do make themſelues to be laughed at in deſning that which is not giuen vnto them. For a man which deſireth to vſe mery conceits and ieſts, ought to beware of two vices. The one is, that he do nothing of compulſion, or laugh ouer much, as there are a great many which haue cold laughters, the which do ſeeme as though they were pulled out of their throat by force. The other is, not to vſe baudy &amp; ſilthy talk, the which is called in Latine <hi>ſcurrilitas,</hi> in our language pleaſant ieſtes.</p>
                  <p>But to keepe the meane, that is to know how to ſpeak effectually and with a good grace, ſo for to recreate that there be nothing ſpoken fooliſhly, at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or vncomely, which is no common vertue. I doe ſpeake this by reaſon of theſe preſent Dialogues, out of which a man may ſo gather good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet notwithſtanding he ſhall haue occaſion to laugh. For the matter of it ſelfe is very pleaſant: And is ſet out with ſuch grace, that it cannot be but that a man ſhall take greate pleaſure in the reading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off. Our brother and companion in the worke of the Lord Ieſus, <hi>Peter Viret,</hi> who is the Author, hath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the vertue which I ſaide to be requiſite in that man which will medle himſelfe therein. It is vertue true that as in all other workes he giueth himſelfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better ſtudie and of greater waight: So in theſe Dialogues his principall intent is not to delight the eares. And in verie deede, that ſhoulde be but a ſmall labour, and a paine euill be ſtowed of a man of ſuch witte and knowledge. Furthermore, beſides the giftes that he hath of God, he is called vnto a more higher calling. But foraſmuch as the matter that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand to entreate off, ſheweth that he teacheth by order of paſtime and merrie ieſtes, he pretendeth notwithſtanding the right doctrine, as the true marke to ſhoote at, mingling with the ſame, ſome merrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites
<pb facs="tcp:19820:4"/> as a companion therewith all. Yea in ſuch ſort that this booke is a ſuffient witnes, that be hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler dextentie to doe it, yea euen as much as he will himſelfe: that is to ſay, as much as is needefull or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. I doe knowe that it is a daungerous thing and that no man ought at the firſt ſight to allowe a booke.</p>
                  <p>But I feare not to haue any rebuke of good men, &amp; of ſuch as are of ſounde Iudgement, to haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reading of that booke, as a booke in which the time ſhalbe wel beſtowed. I neede not to bring witnes, nor to ſpeake among thoſe which know the man, This onely knowledge will ſuffice for to aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to ſtay themſelues vpon it. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it may bee that ſome for want of aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will make none accompt, to proue what it is: I haue partly teſtified what it is, for to giue encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto thoſe which wil beleeue me, &amp; to ſtir them forwarde to ſee them, vntill ſuch time as they may Iudge of themſelues. Not that I doe preſume ſo much as to attribute vnto my ſelfe the Iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the workes of others, for to pronounce them as for authoritie: or to bring all the Readers vnto mine opinion or aduiſe. Yet neuertheleſſe bicauſe that I thinke and am altogether perſwaded, that many will not refuſe to ſtaye and content themſelues to that, that I affirme vnto them: I am conſtrayned for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of them to ſpeake my minde. Although it is not now needeful to ſet foorth at large all the profite that may be gathered, and the pleaſure that may bee taken therein. This onely I can certifie, that all thoſe which ſhall haue the patience to continewe the reading ouer it, will not repent themſelues to be ſo well occupied.</p>
                  <p>There is one onely point, which I knowe, which might diminiſh the grace of the booke towards ſome men: That is, that it ſhoulde ſeeme good that the matters of the Chriſtia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tie ought to be intreated off
<pb facs="tcp:19820:5"/> with a grauitie correſpondent to their dignitie and worthineſſe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is not meete to mingle them with matters of myrth, conſidering that there is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that in ſo doing wee ſhoulde turne them into laughing. Chiefely at this preſent time, in whiche impyetie ouerfloweth more then euer ſithence the beginning of the Chriſtian Church: Or at the leaſt wiſe, it is more openly vncouered. To the ende that none for being preuented with that reaſon, bee not out of taſt with the reading. It is to be noted, that one may diſpute of the matters of the Chriſtianitie two wayes: Firſt in rebuking the fooliſh ſuperſticions, which are riſen among the Chriſtians vnder colour of Religion, the which notwithſtanding are not but corruptions of the ſame, for to deſtroy and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe it. Secondly, in declaring the ſimple and pure veritie according as it is reuealed vnto vs of GOD by his holy worde. As touching the ſeconde kinde, it is moſt certeine that aſſoone as wee haue opened our mouthes for to ſpeake of GOD, no merrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite or ieſt ought to enter in our matter: But wee ought in all that we ſay and ſpeake, declare what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence we doe beare vnto his Maieſtie, not pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one worde but in feare and humilytie. But in diſiphering and diſcloſing the ſuperſtitions &amp; follyes with which the poore worlde hath beene blinded in before time, he could not choſe in ſpeaking of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo ridiculous but to laugh with open mouth. It is moſt true that there is alſo good occaſion to weepe and lament: Foraſmuch as it is not a ſport or ieſt that the glory of GOD, and his eternall veritie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene ſo darkened, the which ought to bee had in vs in a ſinguler recommendation, hath beene ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed thorow infinit lyes: that ſo many poore ſoules haue beene ledde of Sathan into ruyne and dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19820:5"/>
                  <p>But the one muſt not let the other, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and taking ſuch ſorrowe as we ought to haue, to bring vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in remembrance, how God hath beene ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: hauing alſo pitie and compaſsion of the calamitie wherein the worlde hath beene ſo long time, and is yet at this preſent. Yet neuertheles in reherſing of ſuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh dreames and fonde bables, we vſe ſuch mocketies as they doe merite and deſerue. When we doe ſo, it ſhalbe after the example of the Prophets: who interpreting of the pure veritie of God, doe ſpeake with a maieſtie, which ought to make all the worlde to tremble: But in blaming the dreams of the Idolaters do make it no doubt to vſe ſcoffings and laughings, for to declare howe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous they are. Although the Prophets are one &amp; we an other. For aſmuch as we ſpeake not in the name of God as they, to the end that all that which we pronounce ſhoulde be receiued as a reuelation come from Heauen: It is lawefull for vs to vſe a baſer ſtile. But I haue allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this compariſon onely for to declare, that it is not to giue any occaſion vnto the Luci aniſts and Epicures and other contemners of God, to ſpeake euill of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, or to haue it in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, when they ſhal mocke of the corruptions of the ſame.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſayd in a common prouerbe: he which hath ſuffered nothing, knoweth not what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <note place="margin">A prouerbe.</note> is. And therefore it is very hard, that he which neuer hath ſuffered any euill, can haue ſuch pittie and compaſſion of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and miſerable, as he which hath tryed and proued great miſeries and néede, and which hath bene exerciſed in them, and hath abidden many aduerſities and troubles. For he that knoweth not what pouertie is, doth not much thincke vppon the neceſſities of the poore, nor he cannot ſo well know in what languer and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery they doe lyue. When the ryche man hath hys féete well ſhodde, and that hée is well cladded and pompeouſly apparelled, he ſitteth at the table, he hath of delicate meate great aboundaunce, amongeſt which he banketeth and maketh greate cheere, he thincketh not much vpon <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who lyeth at his gate full of botches and ſores, naked, <note place="margin">Luc. 16. l. 20.</note> and hauing no nouriſhment.

And without ſéeking to farre the examples of the Patriarkes and Prophets: As <hi>Abraham Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, Moſes, Dauid,</hi> and other lyke, whiche haue bene tryed wyth ſo many tribulations. Let vs one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider how the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt woulde make his
<pb facs="tcp:19820:8"/> two Apoſtles, Sainct <hi>Peter</hi> and Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> to humble themſelues before that he dyd committe hys Church vnto them, and after that, they had the charge giuen them. Hée <note place="margin">Heb. 4. d. 15.</note> whiche was in all pointes tempted, like as wée are: but yet wythout ſinne, to the ende that wée ſhoulde not doubt, but that hée knoweth our infirmities, and that hée can haue compaſſion of them, hath ſuffered <hi>Peter</hi> to fall, that <note place="margin">The fall of Peter. Mat. 26. g. 25. Luc 22. l. 60</note> by his fall, hée may learne to knowe himſelfe, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all other poore ſinners inuironed with mannes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, for to comfort and confirme them, after that hée ſhall ariſe agayne. Alſo hée ſuffered <hi>Saul</hi> to erre a longe <note place="margin">The errour of Saul. Act. 7. 8. 9</note> time, before hée called him to the light of the Goſpell, &amp; to bring him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> right way, to the ende that after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould departe from the darke clowdes of ignoraunce, ſhoulde haue more greater pittie and compaſſion of the poore blinde and ignoraunt, and that hée ſhoulde not diſpaire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent of the health and ſaluation of the rebells and perſecutors. Alſo we cannot denie, that there is any man liuing vpon the earth, but that hée hath bene plunged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The darkneſſe of the vvorld. Exo. 10. l. 22.</note> the head in the darkeneſſe of errour and ignoraunce, the which were more thicker vppon all the lande, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And woulde to GOD, that thoſe which are yet couered in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> may at the leaſt wiſe feele and perceiue as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> dyd theirs, and that they would deſire with ſuch affection to be deliuered. But this is the miſchiefe that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> which are at this preſent time cannot acknowledge what they are, <note place="margin">The Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time.</note> but woulde be taken and accompted for the true <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And notwithſtanding that they haue the darkeneſſe palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amonge them, yet they glory and bragge themſelues of the light, and doe promiſe it vnto others, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which they ſhall haue néede to hée illuminated themſelues. Wherfore ſo much the more ought we to haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greater compaſſion on them, as they haue the leſſe knowledge of the euil &amp; dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger wherein they are. Thoſe then vnto whome the Lorde hath opened their eyes, and that he hath brought them from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19820:8"/> of <hi>Goſan,</hi> béeinge ſeperated from thoſe horrible darkeneſſe, ought to trauayle wyth <hi>Moſes</hi> that good ſeruaunt of God, not onely to drawe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of the lande of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but alſo if it be poſſible to conuert the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> into <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> praying the LORD to driue awaye all darkeneſſe, by the light of his woorde, and the cléereneſſe of his comming. For if we will not lye agaynſt our owne conſcience, who can denye but that all the worlde is a very <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and all the Chriſtianitie a very <hi>Babilon,</hi> full of all confuſion? For hée that will well ponder and <note place="margin">Aegypt and Babilon.</note> marke the language that the Chriſtians doe ſpeake, &amp; the diuerſities of opinions which are amonge them, but that he ſhall be conſtrained to ſay, that <hi>Babilon</hi> is not <hi>Babilon,</hi> in compariſon of this. The one ſaith white, the other bcack. That which the one calleth day, one other calleth it night. That which is the light vnto the one, is darkeneſſe to the other. That which the one findeth ſwéete, the other iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſowre. That which is Ieſus Chriſt, truth, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe to the one, is Antechriſt, lyinge and hell to the other. What is then to be done in this great varietie and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of opinions? What ought the poore ignoraunt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thinck of it? In what trouble and perplexitie ought their poore conſciences to be in, when they ſée the one to denie that which an other affirmeth? What opinion ought they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow? and of what ſide can their poore conſciences finde moſt reſt? It is moſt certeine, that there is but one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; that in ſuch varietie and contrarietie of opinions and <note place="margin">One onely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> ſentences, there cannot be but one true, and it may well hée that they are all falſe, if man followe any other guide, then Gods onely veritie. What then is he that is of ſo ſure a iudgement, which can ſurely iudge what is the beſt, the moſt certaynteſt and infallible veritie? There is none which can better iudge of the Arte, then the woorkeman: of a matter, then he which hath ſome knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. If we will then finde any reſt in our conſciences, and obteyne and get a good iudgement, for to diſcerne in that diuerſitie of doctrine, what is the beſt and moſte
<pb facs="tcp:19820:9"/> certeinteſt, and what is the truth that declareth all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The meanes for to finde out the truth.</note> to be lyinges, we muſt gyue our ſelues to the meanes by which we may atteine therevnto. But it is harde to finde, for it muſt be ſearched for out of all creatures, and yet neuertheleſſe by the creatures. And therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the thing ſéemeth to be harde, and that I ſée many poore conſciences very much troubled and almoſte in diſpaire, not knowing on which ſide to tourne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo much is the thinge more worthy of pittie and compaſſion. And for bicauſe that I my ſelfe haue bene longe ynough ſicke in that ſame bedde, and haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and proued howe daungerous that euilt is, and what dolour and torment it bringeth vnto the man that feareth God, and which is afraide to offend hym, for that cauſe am I the more moued to ayde and ſuccour thoſe which are yet holden faſt in the ſame, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the ende finde remedy.

To promiſe remedy vnto a diſeaſe ſo harde and incurable, I dare not of my ſelfe, and I will not do as the <note place="margin">Sape etiam eſt holitor valde op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuna locutus.</note> venturous and hardie <hi>Emperickes</hi> doe, which promyſe helpe vnto all diſeaſes, howe incurable ſo euer they hée: and thoſe which are moſt ignoraunt, doe moſte aſſure it. But I dare promiſe to declare, that the diſeaſe is not ſo harde to be cured as it is daungerous, if one prouyde not remedy in time, and wythout delaying the meanes whileſt it is poſſible: And that the difficultneſſe that is in it doe not procéede but of vs, whiche haue the remedye in our handes, if we knowe howe to vſe it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that I nor no man that is in the worlde, cannot, of himſelfe remedy it, yet neuertheleſſe I truſt throughe the helpe and aide of hym which hath it in hys power, and which doth comfort thoſe whome it pleaſeth hym, that I wyll declare and ſhewe vnto thoſe which haue néede, ſome redreſſe to atteyne vnto it. For although that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19820:9"/> I knowe not very much, and haue not ſéene much, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I can not deny but that the Lord, who through his grace and mercy hath drawen mée from thoſe troubles and anguiſhes, and from darkeneſſe, vnto the knowledge of the truth, hath alſo made me prone many thinges, of which I maye helpe my poore bretheren, whome I can not deſpyſe without dooinge vnto them iniurye and wronge, and to ſhewe that I haue forgotten the eſtate in which I haue bene, and that I am vnthanckefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Gods liberalitie and goodneſſe, who immediatlye from my youth, béeing yet at the ſchooles, hath drawen me from that labarinth of errour, before that I was to much plunged in that <hi>Babilonical</hi> Antechriſt, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the marke of the beaſt. Neuertheleſſe notwithſtanding that it hath pleaſed God, that that carecter and marke was not printed in my forehead (to the which yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe A. prepared my ſelfe, thincking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the right waye of ſaluation, if the Lorde had not had pittie and compaſſion, on mée, who called mee vnto a better vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet I cannot therefore denie, but that I haue bene ſufficiently plunged and very déepe in that whore of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> aſwell as others. Although I haue not bene none of the gouernours and chiefeſt Eurgeſſes and Citizens of the ſame, yet I haue bene of the meaner ſort &amp; prepared for to bring foorth the fruites of confuſion, as the others dyd, and ſo much the more that by Nature I was more giuen vnto religion, the which yet neuertheleſſe I knewe not, following in ſteede thereoff all ſuperſtition. Wherefore, ſithens that the Lord hath taken mée out, I can not yet forget thoſe that are detayned and kept therein. And in remembring and conſidering the trayne of the newe <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> it maketh me ſo remember a lawe and cuſtome that <note place="margin">The lavve of the Babilonians for the diſeaſed, Herodo, It. 1.</note> the auncient <hi>Babilonians</hi> had, the which is not altogether to be deſpiſed nor vnworthy to be remembred. Before that Phiſicke was yet brought into any perfect Aite, and that there was not cunninge Phiſitions for to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, they dyd ſet downe a lawe, by which they ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:19820:10"/> that thoſe which did begin to be ſicke and diſeaſed, ought to go vnto thoſe, which ſometime haue bene ſicke with the ſame diſeaſe, for to haue their aduice &amp; counſaile, and for to learne by them the remedy which they vſed, if they had proued any good, and which were wel to be found. And to the ende that that law ſhould be the better kept, they vſed to bring thoſe that were ſicke and diſeaſed vnto the ſtréets and open places: and thoſe which ſometime had bene ſicke, were bounde by the lawe to viſite them, and to teach vnto euery one of them the remedy by the which they were healed. If then the <hi>Babilonians</hi> were ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the ſicke and diſeaſed: let vs thincke what reproche we ſhall haue of God, if after that hée hath made vs féele his grace, and hath giuen vnto vs the remedy, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the diſeaſes both of body and ſoule, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corporall and ſpirituall deathe, we haue no pittie and compaſſion on our bretheren which are yet in the bedde of deathe, and if we doe not ſhowe vnto them the remedye that we haue learned of GOD, and that we doe not bringe them vnto the highe and ſouereigne Phiſition IESUS CHRIST?

                  <p>It is very true, that one ſhall finde men inough, which will promiſe remedyes for ſuch diſeaſes, but he ſhall not finde many which haue well proued and tryed that which they teach vnto others. For many men ſometime wyll meddle or take vppon them to heale others, which haue more néede of a medicine, then thoſe vnto whome they would giue it, and there are more Phiſicions then diſeaſes. And although I will not glorye nor boaſte my ſelfe to be very able and cunning in that matter, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I will not hyde that lyttle talent which the LORDE hath giuen vnto mée. I am not ignorant, but that the Lord hath rayſed vp in theſe our dayes, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men which haue already very well declared and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe obſcure and darke places, of which ſo many poore conſciences are troubled, after whome I am not worthy to carry their bookes, but doe eſtéeme it a greate benefite of GOD to haue bene their diſciple and ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and by their meanes to haue vnderſtanded GODS truth, although that many bookes haue bene alreadye made and ſet foorth in our countrey by diuers learned, for to diſcouer the abuſes, and for to put agayne the woorde of GOD in his honour, according as our Sauiour IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST inſtituted it.

Wherefore it is good that ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which doe touch and conſerne our health and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be manifeſted and ſette foorth in all languages, to the ende that thoſe which do not vnderſtande the one, may be inſtructed by the other. For it is all one what language one ſpeaketh vnto vs, ſo that we vnderſtand him, and that we may be well inſtructed in the will of God, and in all things <note place="margin">All languages good to God.</note> neceſſary vnto our ſaluation. For God regardeth not the languages, but onely the thing to which all languages ought to ſerue. Then euen as thoſe who doe wryte in a language which is moſt common to euery Nation, and by which they may inſtruct and teach, not onely thoſe of their countrey, but alſo of ſtraunge countreys, are worthy of great prayſe: So I doe iudge them worthy to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not worthy to be accounted for chriſtian men, to occupy themſelues ſo much to teach the moſt wiſeſt and beſt learned, and thoſe which are ſo farre ſeperated from vs, and that the poore ignoraunt, and thoſe of the houſe ſhould hée deſpiſed, and ſhould féele nor receiue any fruite. One might rightly rebuke and checke vs: Phiſition heale thy ſelfe: And that we doe not followe the example of Ieſus Chriſt and his Prophetes and Apoſtles, who haue <note place="margin">Luc. 4. d. 23.</note> alwayes taught thoſe with whome they had to doe, in a language that they coulde beſte vnderſtande. For that cauſe was gyuen vnto the Apoſtles the gyfte of tongues, for to preach vnto all people and Nations, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing <note place="margin">The gift of tongues. Act 2. 2. 1.</note> that the language ought to ſerue to the matter, and not the matter to the language. Wherefore conſidering that ſome men doe write in <hi>Hebrewe,</hi> ſome in <hi>Greeke,</hi> ſome in <hi>Latin,</hi> others in <hi>Almayne</hi> and in <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> others in <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> I haue alſo written in a langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, with which I am beſt acquainted and haue moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie, <note place="margin">French bookes</note> according to my byrth and natiuitie: Although that the matters that I entreate off, ſhoulde haue a greater grace in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue then in the <hi>French</hi> tongue, and ſhoulde be vnto me more aduauntage. For oftentimes, I haue the matter ready, that I néede not but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19820:11"/> to write them out of good Authours, where I néede not to trauaile to tranſlate the thinges in <hi>French</hi> the whiche is very harde and impoſſible, eſpecially vnto mée to ſette them out wyth ſuch grace, and to interprete them ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely as they ſound in their naturall language, <hi>Hebrewe, Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> For although I bée a poore Oratour in Latin, I am not much better in <hi>French.</hi> Wherefore although I doe not ſpeake the language of <hi>Attica,</hi> nor well beautified &amp; lyke a Retricion, but that it happeneth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that I doe fall into my rude ſpeache: Or if I wander aſtraye in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and that I come agayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the countrey, I doe thincke that the fauourable Reader wyll well beare wyth ſuch faultes, and eſpecially in the rymes and <hi>French</hi> verſes, which ſometyme I mingle in theſe Dialogues, following the example of the good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, which haue willingly kept this cuſtome, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate into verſe, after their owne language, that whiche they alledge of the Poets, which haue written it in an other language: The which I haue done ſometime, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that I put in the margentes thoſe Authours, by the which I helpe my ſelfe, for to diſcouer and vnhide better the abuſes and ſuperſtitions, to the ende that ſome men ſhoulde not thincke that I ſpeake of the ſpeakers of the Dialogues for the nonce, and wythout iuſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If ther be in my verſes but little rime, it ſufficeth me ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it haue ſome reaſon. For I do not make profeſſion of Poetry: &amp; it ſufficeth me to tourne them groſly or plainely: Beſides that, that I am an euill Oratour, yet I am a worſe Poet. Yet neuertheleſſe I am fully certified that ſo many good mindes and wittes as <hi>Fraunce</hi> bringeth vp very able and experte, both in Poetry and <hi>French</hi> proſe, ſhall haue none occaſion to enuye mée, nor to rebuke or finde faulte with my Poetry. For they may very well iudge that I pretende not by my verſes to haue the crowne of Baye, and that I wyll not take from them their Science and name. Alſo I hope that thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome GOD hath gyuen more gyftes and grace

But theſe héere of whom I doe ſpeake, doe not follow the ſtile, I ſay not, of ſome good diuine, nor onely of ſome good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim Philoſopher, but doe ſéeme that they are altogether giuen to the immitation of <hi>Luſian,</hi> a man without God and <note place="margin">Luſian and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaniſtes.</note> without Religion, a mocker and deſpiſer of God and men.

<pb facs="tcp:19820:18"/> thoſe which haue any feare God, to account them for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianiſtes.</hi> And vnto thoſe which haue nothing, or a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to pull them away altogether, and to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule &amp; goe backe from the truth more then they were: As dayly wée ſée it by experience in young children, merchants, gentlemen, damoiſels, and courtiers, who after that they haue taſted of ſuch bookes, are cleane out of taſte, &amp; cannot away with all other, which are not like vnto them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would gladly counſaile ſuch men of ſo good a minde and ſpirite, which giue themſelues to make ſuch bookes, and I deſire and pray them in the name of Ieſus Chriſte, and ſo much as they loue his honour and theirs, to applie that goodly wit and vnderſtanding which GOD hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them, and that rhetoricke and gift of eloquence, wherewith they are indued, into ſome better ſtudy, &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more profitable, to the ende they bée not rebuked and blamed to haue abuſed the gyft of God againſt his honour and glorie. For that cauſe I haue purpoſed to write af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort, which peraduenture will ſéeme very euilly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with a <hi>Theologian,</hi> to wit, vnto one which wil ſpeake of diuine letters: But I thincke that when men ſhal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my reaſons, they will take my aduice and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in good parte, and I will leaue vnto none any iuſte occaſion to accuſe and rebuke mée in that I rebuke others, except that men loue rather to ſerue to their affections and to vſe ſlaunders, then to iudge of thinges accordinge to truth and equitie. I haue already touched ſome reaſons which haue induced mée to do that, beſides yet I wyl adde too many others. The firſt is, that I would aſſay to make thoſe learne by my example which haue a better wyt then I, to doe that which I my ſelfe cannot: the whiche thinge ought not to ſéeme to ſtraunge. For a whetſtone &amp; a whéele doe ſharpen well the Iron, and maketh it to cut, and yet neuertheleſſe it is not ſharpe nor cutteth of it ſelfe: And at the leaſt wiſe I indeuour my ſelfe to ſhewe vnto thoſe good wittes and ſpirites, which delyght themſelues in pleaſaunt thinges, and which occupie themſelues to ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19820:18"/> vanities, and matters in the which they maye exerciſe their vnderſtanding and cloquence, more to their honour before GOD and good people, and to more greater profit then they doe, if they will not apply themſelues vnto mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to high and waightie, as many haue done, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the olde as the newe. And if I my ſelfe cannot doe that which I would teach vnto others, at the leaſte wiſe I will ſerue them in ſtéede of a patterne, wherein they may finde ſome thing for to followe: Or at the leaſte wiſe, the fault y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they ſhal finde in my manner of procéeding, wyll admoniſhe them of the vices that they ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde in their writinges, the which if they finde in my ſtile, or in my inuention, or diſpoſition, I am ſure that they ſhall not finde in the ſentence and ſubſtaunce of the matters, any thing vnworthy for a Chriſtian man. For whatſoeuer thinge that it bée, I beléeue that one ſhall finde nothing which may induce to hereſie, except thoſe who of themſelues doe pretende therevnto, and who as the Spiders doe drawe the venym from all places, and hereſies out of the holy Scriptures, which are gyuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs to kéepe vs from all hereſie.

Mée thinkes that ſuch people haue no iuſt occaſion to condempne vs in that behalfe. For if they are too wiſe, and doe thincke that ſuch things <note place="margin">Cuer vviſe.</note> agrée not with the grauitie of their perſons, then let them leaue them to be ſpoken of the fooles, ſith that as men doe <note place="margin">The priuiledge of Fooles.</note> ſay they haue the priuiledge to ſpeake all things.

For ther is none of a good <note place="margin">Licence and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</note> iudgement, but that he vnderſtandeth very well that in the phraſe of writing there is no greater libertie and licence in Poetry, then Dialogues and talkes. For they muſt bring in the perſons ſpeaking according to him whom they repreſent: who oftentimes do ſpeake more after their ſence and of the perſons whom they doe ieſt at, then according or after the ſame of the authour. Although that the author hath willingly vſed to chooſe ſome one by whom he giueth to vnderſtande what is his opinion, and the beſt ſentence.

I knowe not whether the ſages haue ſéene the abuſes ſo vncouered, and whether they (which dare not ſpeke of Ieſus Chriſt but with halfe a mouth, and dare not preach but ſecretly) haue founde people among them of ſo ſharpe and earneſt a ſpirite, that they doe know all things and are ignoraunt of nothing. But as for vs which are héere, we haue experience cleane contrary. For ſithens that the Goſpell hath bene preached already ten or twelue yeares in ſome places, and fréely (the which men dare not in all places) and the abuſes haue ben manifeſted ſo cléere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and playnly as the ſame is cléere at hye noone, we are yet all abaſhed, that we doe finde dreamings, errours and great ſuperſtitions in ſome, yea in thoſe in whome a man would not thinke, and yet we doe thinke that we haue alreadye much profited in the knowledge of God.

For if they had intelligence and vnderſtanding ſuch as they thincke to haue, and that they dyd knowe the abhomination ſuch as it is, and howe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth God, and is noiſome and hurtfull vnto his church, they would retyre and drawe themſelues further from it then they doe, and it ſhould bée vnpoſſible that they could ſée and ſuffer it, but would flée rather away from thence, or they would ſuffer themſelues rather to bée burned, then to diſſemble and conſent vnto it: But would ſay as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of whom the Prophet hath written, which doe conſider the grace which God hath done vnto them, and comparing them with their firſt condition, ſay, to the great abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">

Ieſus Chriſt came with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and gentleneſſe, and they ſaid that he was a drunkard and a glutton, and a friend vnto publicans and ſinners. If one do ſpeake vnto them ſharply, as their iniquitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they ſay that one is furious and mad. If one do ſpeake vnto them pleaſantly, they will call him foole or ſcoffer. To couclude, they will alwaies finde ſome thing to ſay, as wée ſée it by experience in our time. Many men at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning haue taken vppon them to touch a little ſome abuſes, yet of the moſt groſeſt &amp; moſt apparant. Theſe Hipocrites could not beare them, but they haue perſecuted them by ſea and land. They cannot onely ſuffer that one ſhould touch a little with his finger their Idolatry &amp; ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that one ſhould open his mouth for to ſpeak one word for to reforme their eſtate, but which is more, haue declared themſelues to be enemies vnto all learned &amp; wiſe men, which haue trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to aboliſh all barberouſneſſe and ſophiſtrie for to ſet vp againe all good letters and other diſciplines, &amp; haue accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemned them for heritickes, and haue put them in great daunger of their liues. Sith then that they cannot ſuffer thoſe héere, that they ſhould goe ſo pleaſantly, not onely of little dialogues, &amp; familiar talke for little children, which doo vnto them yet more greater honour then they deſerue and do flatter them more then is néed, God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp others, who haue in ſuch ſort remoued their filthines, the which others haue not done but a little tickled vp, that they haue in ſuch ſort made the filthineſſe and ſtinke ſo to auoide, that all the world doth perceiue and foole it, in ſuch ſort that one can no longer abide and ſuffer it. When theſe ſharpe ſurgeons are come, which haue thruſt their inſtrument ſo deepe within the Apoſtume, that they haue perced them euen vnto the heart, and bones, they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to reiect y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt which did but a little touch the wounds and ſores without, and through their gentleneſſe make them to feſter and waxe worſe and worſe, makinge of it but a certeine pallatiue cure or healing.

<pb facs="tcp:19820:26"/> againſt them, and haue bene conſtrained to prayſe the firſt whome they condempned in compariſon of thoſe héere.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, came conſequently others who haue a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better vncouered their diſceite, and which haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſted the villany and the fornications of the great whoore of <hi>Babilon,</hi> inſomuch that thoſe whome men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted to bée ſo earneſt and ſuch heretickes, haue begun by them to bée eſtéemed gentle and good men, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the latter.

Wherefore mée thincks they can no more pretende ignoraunce nor infirmitie, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iuſt excuſe, but that it is tyme to aunſwere to a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, to the ende hée thincke not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note place="margin">

And therefore I thincke that thoſe that are of a good iudgement, and which doe conſider the thinges according to the truth, ſhall bée conſtrained to confeſſe that I flatter to much.

Inſomuch, that me thinckes that I haue not written any thing which may bring hurt vnto the Chriſtian religion.</p>
                  <p>And though I doe not profite very much, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe there wanted in mée no wyll. Wherefore I doe truſt that the good men will take all in the beſte parte: whome onely I feare to offende. If the wycked are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye wythout a cauſe, I will leaue them for ſuch as they are: yet I ſpeake neuertheleſſe the veritie, although they will not take it.
<pb facs="tcp:19820:27"/> If the wiſe and learned cannot much profit, it is ſufficient for me that the poore ignoraunt people ſhould receiue ſome fruite: Although that ſuch a one doe thincke himſelfe very wiſe and learned, that he may yet finde ſome thing for to learne. It is very true that that matter requireth better to be intreated off in <hi>Latine</hi> then in <hi>French.</hi> For it conteineth things which would haue ben plainer &amp; which would haue bene entreated off more briefly, the which peraduenture I may be rebuked for ouermuch prolixitie &amp; tediouſnes. But there are many reaſons which are the cauſe. The firſt, is for that I am one of thoſe Oratours which know not to enter in talke, or begin any matter, nor which know not howe to leaue off. The ſecond, bicauſe that I doe write moſt of all for the ignorant and rude people, for whom we had néed to chew their meates a little, and to declare the matters more groſly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which they cannot vnderſtand in one word, as thoſe that are wiſe &amp; learned, which wil comprehend it very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as thoſe which haue read the Authours out of whome I haue taken the matter. Therefore there is yet an other reaſon: that is, that I muſt vſe great circumlocutions and narrations for to expreſſe and declare that which in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> or in <hi>Greeke</hi> myght bee ſpoken in one woorde. For the things are more harde vnto thoſe which haue not read the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> authours. But I haue tolde alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye the cauſes which haue moued mée to write rather in this language then in an other. And if the matter bee worthy to bée put in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, if it pleaſe the Lorde, it may bée done at leaſure: or it maye moue the heart of ſome which will do it better. Be it as it is, it is to mée ſufficient, ſo that I doe ſerue a little the good. If I doe offende the Hipocrites, I would be contented that they bée offended with mée, ſo that they doe finde better taſt in all the other which haue ſpoken and written of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion a great deale better then I, and ſo that they haue them in ſuch honour and reuerence as they ought to haue. <note place="margin">Hiſtories of our time.</note> Alſo I thinke that none ſhall finde vnfitte for the matter many of the hiſtories of our time, the which I haue ſet in

For if it be lawfull to alleage the auncient hiſtoryes written by others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we not ſpeake of that which is done in our time when occaſion ſerueth? Sith that ſo many things do come dailye more worthy of remembraunce then many of thoſe which the auncients haue written? Wherefore I haue not eſtéemed and thoughte that to bée a thinge inconuenient nor vnworthy of remembraunce, which we our ſelues and our fathers are witneſſes. Alſo I haue put the quotations of the authours in the margents, out of whome I haue taken that which I haue alleaged, to the ende it ſhould not appeare that I haue inuented them of mine owne head, aſwell of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, Poets, Hiſtoriographers, as Doctors, Queſtionaries, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters, as of the auncient Doctors of the Church and holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>IN this firſt part and firſt Dialogue I doe amply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the matters which concerne thoſe that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, declaring the errours, abuſes, &amp; ſuperſtitions, which are committed about them, and the falſe and diuerſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which haue bene and yet are among men, aſwel tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the eſtate of the bodies as of the ſoules. And of hell, Limbus patrum and of Purgatorie. And how that which the ſuperſticious Chriſtians do about the dead, is nothing at all lyke vnto the woord of God, but is altogether taken of the Infidells &amp; Panims. And for to enter into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I bring in the perſons who take their theame and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon a fermon which they heard of an holy father, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of ſuch matters. And although the matter might ſeeme wholy to be fayned, yet it hath the foundacion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a true hiſtory. For mine intent is partly in this firſt diſputacion, to rebuke the ſottiſh and vayne curioſitie of fooliſh Preachers and Doctors, who haue forſaken the principal points of the holy Scripture to occupy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnprofitable queſtions &amp; vayne contemplations, &amp; to enquire, of things that they cannot know and which wee haue not to doe withall. And which ſerue to none other ende but to hinder and let the poore Chriſtian people to ſeeke out the will of God, to induce and lead them to falſe religion, ſuperſticion, Idolatay and all Paganiſme. Alſo I declare the Arguments of the Popes Purgatorie with the Purgatorie of the Panims, and the ceremonies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticions which they vſe about the dead, &amp; out of what ſpring they iſſued, and what haue bene the purgations of the Panims which the Idolatrous Chriſtians do yet keepe: and how the Papiſticall Purgatory hath ſerued the inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able auarice of thoſe which doe lyue to deſtroy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure all the poore world. Alſo how the prieſts Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is burned, how fire hath taken the ſame and what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is prepared for thoſe which go vnto ſtrange fire
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19820:28"/> to be purged from their ſinnes any other then the fire of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: and how the prieſts do diſagree both from the word of God, and from their owne doctrine, decrees and canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. After thoſe things we ſhal enter into the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part which ſhall entreat of the appearing of the ſpirites of thoſe that be dead. All theſe things ſhalbe yet more playnly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode and better confirmed by the Dialogues follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the which the laſt ſhalbe of the immortalitie of the ſoules and the reſurrection of the fleſh. Afterwardes we will come vnto the lyuing, and in the other parts wee ſhall enter into matters yet more graue, more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of greater importance, for the preſent time, to ſhew what is the eſtate of the world &amp; of relygion, and by what meanes that man which feareth God, and the poore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and doubtfull conſciences, may be aſſured and know what is the true Church &amp; the truth, and wherevnto they may ſurely ſtay themſelues, and how they may be certeine what doctrine is of God. I haue intituled this firſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue the Alchymee of Purgatory, chiefely for two cauſes. The firſt bicauſe I declare how the auncient Panims and our prieſts after their example doe trauayle to extract the fifte eſſence of the ſoules which they melt in their furnaces of Purgatory. The other is, bicauſe from thoſe furnaces our prieſts do drawe out the Philoſophicall ſtone.</hi>

                        <p>Such is their doctrine: But notwithſtanding when it commeth to triall, they neyther haue regarde to mortall nor yet veniall ſinnes, but ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the riches or to the pouertie. It is all one with them whether the ſinnes be mortall or veniall, ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or inſanable, ſo that the dead hath wherewith to paye their drougs &amp; medicines, &amp; money for his raunſome, and letters of grace that they make for them by their buls and pardons. And as touching the poore, of whome they haue no profite, it is to them all one whether they go, be it into Paradiſe, Hell, or Purgatory. For they haue no care of the ſoules, but onely of their purſes.</p>

                        <p>Thereby you maye knowe that the Poets haue had more witte and reaſon and better colour ſo to do then the Prieſtes. For they haue conſidered the nature of the ſinnes, and of the ſinners together, as a good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <note place="margin">The Phiſicions of the ſoule.</note> doth behold the completion of thoſe that are ſicke, for to giue vnto euery one a conuenient and ſit remedy for his diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>For they haue regarde that mans bodye was made of the foure Elements, and that the completion and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19820:38"/> of man doe follow the temperatneſſe of the body, and the nature of the elements, of which they were made. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch then as the body is the houſe and habitacion of the ſoule, &amp; that the ſoule hath bene holden within that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body as in a priſon, and darke dungeon, it is impoſſible, but that it is corrupted and defiled with the filthineſſe of that infectious body, as he which ſhall depart out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious and ſtincking priſon. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> and the other Philoſophers and Poets, which followed his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue thought, that the ſoules had néede of ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, after that they were ſeperated from the body, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that after their departing, it was impoſſible but that they ſhould carry with them and kéepe ſome filthineſſe of that corrupt fleſh, bicauſe of the coniunction, conuerſation and familiaritie, that they had together. Neuertheleſſe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the bodyes are not all of one complexion, but according to the diſpoſition and temperateneſſe of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which they are made, ſome are more earthely and other ſome more heauenly, &amp; according to the doctrine that they haue receiued, and the exerciſe that they haue had in vertue, ſome more vicious or vertuous then the others: Euen ſo haue they eſtéemed and thought that the ſoules did differ, according to the difference of the bodies from which they came out. They haue then conſidered that there are ſome ſinnes that are more thin, eaſie &amp; lighter then others, holding more of the nature of the ayre, and of the winde, then of the earth. And therefore they muſt purge them by the element, which approcheth néereſt to their nature, and which ſéemeth for them the beſt remedie.</p>
                        <p>The others that are more heauy and wayghtie, as the water is more heauyer and wayghtyer then the ayre and winde, are waſhed in the water: For they doe holde moſt of the nature of the water. And therefore they put them in the bucke, wherein they driue, beat and waſh them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleane.</p>

You may then vnderſtande by theſe reaſons that all theſe lights ſerue nothinge at all for the dead, nor profite them, neither for the body nor yet the ſoule.

                        <p>If the water could any thing profite the deade, it were better to make for them a great bath, &amp; to plunge all their body, in a great tub of Water, and to waſh them well for a good ſpace, then to ſprinckle them ſo little. For me ſéemeth that that manner of dooing is more proper for to kindle the fire of Purgatory, if the Water doth deſcend thether, then for to quench it. And the ſame I wyll proue by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and by examdle. I wyll firſt proue it by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of many good Phiſitions, which ſay that when a man is very drie for want of drincke, it is better for him to drincke a good draught at once then to ſippe often: For that ſame doth not quenche the heate that is in the body, but kindleth it the more. And to the ende that <note place="margin">The examples of the Smithes.</note> it doe not ſéeme that they ſpeake that wythout reaſon, they doe alſo alleadge the example of the Smythes,
<pb facs="tcp:19820:43"/> the which I will bring foorth for my ſeconde argument, which is infallible, inaſmuch as it is alwayes confirmed by experience. For wée ſée that when they woulde haue their <note place="margin">To vvhat ende ſerueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vvash<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of the deade bodies.</note> coales burne well, and to giue great heat they ſprinckle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with water, which they haue alwayes ready, wyth a little ſprinckle or beſome, as the Prieſtes haue them in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water ſtocke. There is yet an other reaſon, for which I doe finde the manner of the Panims better and more low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, bicauſe that at the leaſtwiſe that ſhall ſerue for the dead, for to proue whether they bée dead or not: For it <note place="margin">Thoſe that are aliue reputed to be dead.</note> chaunceth oftentimes through ſome diſeaſe, that the ſpirite is ſo locked and encloſed in the body, that man loſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together his breath, in ſuch ſort that one can by no meanes perceiue it, but iudgeth him to bée dead, and ſo hée is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. By that meanes ſometimes ſome haue bene bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quicke: The which thing ought very much to bée fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all ſuffocations and chokings, and chiefly of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice <note place="margin">Suffocations.</note> of women, and alſo in the time of the peſtilence or plague: wherein many times it hath bene found that they <note place="margin">The time of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</note> haue brought to bée buryed thoſe who were found aliue. Wherefore it is not méete to bury any dead body to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine, eſpecially when hée dyeth ſodeinly. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> may very well ſometime happen vnto man, which we haue proued in ſome beaſtes, namely in the Dormouſe, which haue bene <note place="margin">The Dormouſe.</note> found ſo faſt of ſléepe in the Winter, that it is not poſſible to awake them: As it hath ben many times proued in ſome of them, who although they were cut a ſunder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle did not wag nor ſtur vntill ſuch time as they are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hot ſething water.

                        <p>There is no difference, but that we are more fooliſh &amp; more mad then the Panims.

But I finde them a greate deale wiſer and better aduiſed in that matter, for that they doe ſprinkle theire Sepulchers with water onely, and not with wine, as the Panims that did ſhed out great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of wine, and milke vppon the Sepulchers, and <note place="margin">To offer vvine for the dead.</note> more lyberally then thoſe doe the holy water.</p>

And therefore the fire that he hath ſent is more for to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and make hotte, then for to burne and couſume. But it is of ſuch a nature and force that it draweth after it the fire of the wrath and indignation of God, vpon thoſe which by the ſame will not be illuminated.

And for to declare better what is the vertue of that fire, and what fire he meaneth, he hath ſent his holy Ghoſt vnto his Apoſtles and Diſciples, lyke a tongue of fire, <note place="margin">Act. 2. a. 3 Mat. 3. c. 11 Act. 1. a 5 The true fire of purgatory.</note> witneſſing thereby, that it is hée, of whome <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> hath ſpoken, ſaying: who ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith that we haue already declared in the firſt Dialogue the agreeing of the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, Poeticall, and Papiſticall Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the diuers manners of purgations, that haue bene, aſwell among the Panims as the Chriſtian Idolaters, and howe all thoſe things were inuented by the Prieſtes for to ſerue their auarice, and rapacitie, the which was more greater in them, then it was euer in others: Now we wil bring in, declare and ſette foorth perticulerly their other practiſes, &amp; the office which thei do for the dead, &amp; how at the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, burialls &amp; mortuaries they follow more the errours and abuſes of the Panims, then the examples of the true ſeruaunts of God aſwell in their ſingings and lamentaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they make for the deade, as in torches, lyghtes, belles, ryngings, and ſepultures. Therefore I haue inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled this Dialogue: The office of the deade: In which alſo we will declare, what is the honour that is due vnto the deade: what ought to be the burialls, funeralls, and the ſorrowing of the Chriſtians: what hath bene the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in making, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration &amp; prayers for the dead. Alſo we will declare the principall poynts of the Maſſe of Requiem, that they doe ſing for the dead, and wee will proue by their owne words, that they doe pray rather for the Saints and Saintes, and for thoſe that are in Paradiſe in ioye and celeſtiall reſt, then for thoſe which are in paynes, be it in Purgatorie, or in any other place, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne doctrine: and how by their owne prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they ſufficiently teſtifie and witneſſe that in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine there is nothing that is certeine, and that they holde not thoſe whome they doe iudge to be in Purgatory, as aſſured of their ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>It ſhalbe alſo declared what is the true Purgatory of Ieſus Chriſt, and the true ſatiſfaction of the Chriſtians to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:19820:68"/> God, for their ſinnes: and how the Papiſticall Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and ſatiſfactions doe diſagree altogether from the promiſes of god, &amp; the remiſsion of ſinnes by Ieſus Chriſt, It ſhalbe declared in lyke maner for what cauſe God doth chaſtiſe and puniſh the faythfull in this world, and not in the other: what are the good workes, and wherefore God will iudge men by them: and how we muſt watch and do penaunce, and trauayle whilſt we are in this lyfe, without truſting vppon the good deedes that other will doe for vs after our death. Item, what are the good deeds that we ought to doe for the dead, and wherein we may ſuccour &amp; helpe them, and the great iniury &amp; wrong that the Popes and the Prieſtes doe vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, holding them in the ſincke and dungeon of their peruerſe doctrine and traditions: What fiſhermen they are, and what their flouds and ryuers are wherein they fiſh and catch the golde and ſiluer and not the men: what are their relicks and holy bodyes: and how they do abuſe the dead bodyes to the great diſhonour of God and of his Saints as the Coniurers and Sorcerers doe.

                        <p>You know very well that the Prieſtes haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to breake their faſt, and to eate the ſoppe in the wyne in the middeſt of their Maſſe. Wherefore it were good reaſon that we did pauſe a lyttle in the middes of our Maſſe, for to breathe our ſelues. For we haue ſayd and ſunge inough for the dead for to drinke once: And yet wée are more beneficiall vnto them then the Prieſtes. For wée haue not dronken vppon their coſtes and expences.</p>

For it doth to me more good, then all that which the Prieſtes and Moonkes haue eaten and dronken in the name of the dead; doth profite the dead. It is already longe ſince that I would haue brought in for you that, but I doe alwayes wayte when that <hi>Euſebius</hi> would beginne.

It ought then to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vs to bury honeſtly the bodies of the dead, and to put them in the earth as in their bed, tarrying and lookinge for the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, and the generall reſurrection of all fleſhe. Therefore the Chriſtians doe call the place that is appointed for their buriall <hi>Cimiterium,</hi> bycauſe that it is as the bed, couch and dortoire of the faythfull that be <note place="margin">The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard &amp; dortoyr</note> dead. And therefore it is good to haue ſome certeine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and comely place, as a common repoſitory of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <note place="margin">Thoſe do diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour god which do not bury ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the dead. 1.

For we ſhould doe great wronge vnto our bodyes which are the temple of God, in whom God dwelleth, and which haue bene conſecrated and made holy through the bloude of Ieſus Chriſt vnto his honour and glory, and dedicated vnto the immortall inheritage of his kingdome, if wée doe caſt them to dogges, fowles and wilde beaſtes, as ſhe carryon of wilde and brute beaſtes, as though they ſhould liue no more after they were dead, and bée no perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the immortalitie, no more then beaſtes.

For bicauſe that hir fantaſie was paſt ſhe did thincke that the belles ſayd: Marry not.

                        <p>If you had read diligently the bookes of the good auncient doctors, and eſpecially of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> you might eaſely make all theſe places agrée. For they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge foure opinions &amp; reaſons for to ſatiſfie ſuche doubts. The firſt is, that <hi>Traianus</hi> was rayſed thorow the prayers of Sainct <hi>Gregory,</hi> and that he dath done penance in this life, thorowe the which he meryted grace and pardon of his ſinnes. Wherefore he is dead in the grace of God, and hath bene ſaued, and this is the beſt allowed opinion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctors. The ſecond is, that the ſoule of <hi>Traianus</hi> was not ſimplye deliuered from the paine and fault thereof, but that his paine was ſuſpended and delayed, vntill the daye of iudgement, and afterwardes ſhalbe ſaued. The thyrd opinion is that <hi>Gregory</hi> deliuered him, not from the place of hell, but from the paine. The fourth, which is alſo beſt allowed among all the other, that the ſoule of <hi>Traianus</hi> was deliuered from the paines of hell, and hath obtayned mercie thorow the prayers of Sainct <hi>Gregory:</hi> the which thing was done, not after the common law, but after the diſpoſition and diſpenſation of the wiſdome and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who did foreſee that Sainct <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould pray for him. Wherefore it hath not dampned it by or through diffinitiue ſentence, but by a ſentence ſuſpenciue: The which thing hath bene a perticuler priuiledge. For Sainct <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that the priuiledges are but for a <note place="margin">Priuiledges.</note> fewe people, and not for all. For the priuiledges of a fewe are not lawes common to all: And the things which go out
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19820:102"/> of ſquare from the common lawe, ought not to bee dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen into a conſequence.</p>

For it doth not onely driue away the diuells which are about the bodye, but alſo it quencheth the fire of Purgatory, and mitigateth the paynes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if that he which hath clad himſelfe with it doe dye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Saint <hi>Fraunces</hi> daye. But which is more, it delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">The feaſt of Saint Fraunces.</note> from eternall death, as the Cordeliers doe witneſſe of the king of <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> which was delyuered, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The king of Caſtilia Moſt horrible blaſphemy.

                        <p>The body alſo goeth neither into purgatory nor into hell, but is buryed in the earth, vntill the day of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And bicauſe that there is great conformitie betweene the feaſtes dedicated vnto the dead, as well among the Panims as the papiſticall Chriſtians, we will declare euidently by conferring the one with the other, not onely the agreeing that theſe feaſtes haue togother, but alſo that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt many other ceremonyes ioyned with them, and depending vpon them: The which haue bene borrowed of the Panims by the papiſticall Chriſtians, or at the leaſt wife the imitation is ſo cleere and euident, that there is none but that he may eaſely iudge, that they proceeded all from one ſpirite. For to manifeſt and declare then thys ſame the better, and for to make it the playnelyer to bee ſeene, we will declare pointe by pointe the conformityes which are betweene the one and the other, touching the diuerſe feaſtes and dayes dedicated vnto the deade, and touching the forbiddinge of marriage at certeine times. Afterwardes the conformitie of ſome feaſtes and Idols of the Panims and Papiſtes, and the feaſt of the candels and diuers puriſications obſerued of the one part and of the other: And the conſecrations of Torches, Waxe, Waxcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Salt, holy Water, Fire, Aſſhes and many other ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:19820:121"/> diuers matters, by the which euory one may eaſely iudge, who hath ben the authour of the popiſh Ceremonies: and what difference there is betweene the auncient Panim Rome, and the Romiſh Church, ſuch as it is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. We doe call this Dialogue, Anniuerſaries, or yeares mindes, bicauſe that it maketh mention of many Ceremonies, which yearelye haue bene obſerued among the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and Idolaters about the dead, as of the ſtraunge Gods.</p>

Alſo if they vnderſtand his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meaning they are very malicious and wicked, to peruerte and marre the ſence of the ſame, for to maintaine their abuſes, and alwayes the more to kéepe the poore people in errour. Firſte, they well perceiue and ſée that Sainct Ambroſe maketh no mention, neither of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, <note place="margin">Lamenting and ſorrovving for, the dead.</note> nor of Maſſe for the dead, and that that place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerue but for the ſorrow that men take for the dead. For yet in that time, the Churche approched néerer vnto the puritie of the primatiue Churche, and was not ſo muche corrupted, as ſhe hath bene afterwards, ſithence the time of Pope Pelagius and of Gregory the greate. This then that he maketh mention of the firſt, ſeuenth, thirty, and forty daye, in his booke and ſermon that hée made of the death and buriall of Theodoſius, is not ſet forth by him, for to nouriſhe and holde the pepole in the ſuperſticions of the Panyms, as you doe, but rather to draw them backe from it, and for to induce and leave the Chriſtians vnto more greater honeſty and modeſtye, to the ſorrowe that they ought to haue for the dead. For that cauſe did he propound and ſet foorth the example of the Iſraelites, not that he woulde thereby make a law

For firſt of all God neuer hath defined, nor determined by his lawe, certaine dayes, nor yet to lament and mourne for the dead, nor for to make any commemoration of them, as it appeareth very well, by the examples aſore alledged. For the Iſraelites themſelues haue not kept a certaine number of dayes at the mourninge of Iacob, Moſes, Aaron and of Marie. For they did kéepe Iacob in <note place="margin">Geneſ. 50. a. 3</note> Aegypt fortie dayes, after that hee was enbaumed: and the Aegyptians bewept him Ixx, dayes.

Wherefore we haue no more néede of ſuche ceremonyes, ſith that they are accompliſhed and fulfilled by Ieſus Chriſt: And yet much leſſe of other new, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mans preſumption. That then which the Iſraelites uſed certaine ceremonies and mournings about the dead, had two reſpectes.

They did alſo make markes in theyr fleſhe, with greate ſuperſtition the whiche thinges the Lord did forbid his people, namely in Leuiticus. And therefore thoſe good patriarches and prophets, who were prudent and wiſe, and guyded thorowe the ſpirite of God, haue found a good meanes to let and ſtoppe thoſe vices and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe which they did commit aſwell on the one ſide as on the other, amongſt the Panyms.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19820:127"/> For if the Panims themſelues haue regarded that, and haue néede lawes and ſtatutes, for to correct the vndecent things that was there commytted: And the pompe and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſti coſt, that men beſtowed about ſuch banities, we muſt not be abaſhed, if the people of God, who ought to be the rule and moderation of all others haue ſo well prouided for the ſame, for to kéep a meane in all things. For it is not poſſible that man, how ſpirituall ſoeuer he be, can rob or take from man, all humayne aflection, but that there abydeth alwayes a meruaylous deſire in his heart, of the perſon abſent whom he loued, eſpecially when thorowe death it is ſeperated from him. Sith then that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">The lymitte of humain affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> plucke away altogether that affection from mans heart, he muſt at the lcaſtwiſe ſet ſome lymitte; to the ende that he excede not meaſure, as the Panims did.

The ſame then that the <note place="margin">The time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the mourning</note> Heorewes and Iſraelites had ſome certayne number of dayes, for to mourne and lament their parents and friends that were dead, was not for to reſtrayne euery one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and perticularly to lament and mourne one ſo many dayes, without adding or dimimſhing any, as if the number of the dayes were neceſſary; or that it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any relygion and holyneſſe in it: but to the ende that thoſe which ſhould mourne and lamont, if one coulde not kéepe them from it altogether, without doyng greate bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their affections, at the leaſtwiſe, they ſhould not paſſe that lymit and time, which was bſed and preſcribed, and which was long inough and ſufficient, for to ſatiſfie their heart and to mitigate their ſorrow and heauineſſe.</p>

For they haue not much redde in all the holy Sacripture, which hath more appearaunce at the firſt ſight, for to colour their ceremonyes, &amp; new ſacraments, which they haue inuented without the ordinaunce of Ieſus Chriſt, then that place bath, for to giue lyght vnto theire extreme vnction, and thoſe muttering and mumblyng of the Pſalter which they doe make about the ſicke perſons, And yet neuertheleſſe there is not one onely ſillable vppon which they can ſtay or take hold for to grounde and allow the leaſt of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes and ſuperſticions which they commit about the dead.</p>

But the Prieſts doe make as many Gods as they lyſt, and make them to come downe from heauen when it pleaſeth them. But for to retourne to our matter, after that that poore God was burned, there was two great diſputations. The firſt was, howe one myght diſcerne the aſſhes of the hoaſte, from thoſe of hys Tabernacle. Some held <note place="margin">Diſputacions of the aſshes of the hoſte</note> an opinion, that one could not doe it, others to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye, affirmed that the ſame was verye eaſye, ſayinge that God dyd that honour vnto hys bodye, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of that ſhoulde bée whyter, more ſofter and ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nowe when they had gathered together the
<pb facs="tcp:19820:168"/> ſmootheſt and ſofteſt. There was yet an other diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more barder, to wytte, in what place they ſhoulde put thoſe holy aſſhes.

                        <p>It was a newe practyſe to bring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnto the Prieſtes. For on the one ſide their God had drawen hys parte and hys aſſhes from the other aſſhes.</p>

But <hi>de Boſco</hi> counſayled them, that they ſhould not put that Reliquary in anye hye place, for to auoide the daunger of committinge Idolatrye whiche myght come thereby. For hée declared vnto them accordynge to their owne doctrine, that the bodye of Chriſt was not burned, but the Accidents, and that thoſe aſſhes were not of the bodye, but of the accidentes. Wherefore wée muſt not worſhyppe them, ſith that the bodye is flowen an other waye. Ercept they wyll yet kéepe him pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wythin the duſt and aſſhes.

The other bicauſe that in thoſe holy aſſembles, they dyd make gatheringes for the poore after the example of the primitiue Church. Behold the name of the Chriſtian aſſemblies, which hath longe contynued amonge the auncientes, before that the name of Maſſe was borne.

                        <p>But nowe the Prieſtes doe wronge to call it, <hi>Miſſa,</hi> in the ſinguler number, that is to ſaye, ſent.

Beholde his owne woordes, the which he recited, as ſpoken of Sainct <hi>Peter;</hi> vnto Saint <hi>Clement.</hi> But there is no appearaunce, that Saincte <hi>Peter</hi> hath holden thoſe woordes whiche were attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him in that booke, nor that Sainct <hi>Clement</hi> hath <note place="margin">The booke of Clement.</note> wrytten them, althoughe that the booke is intituled in his name.

Wherefore I muſte here the rude of that cauſe, &amp; the laſt ſentence, the whiche is giuen by the word of God. I haue determined to declare vnto you the cauſe of my voyage. as I haue promiſed, after that <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhal haue done with you: But I am content to deferre it vntill to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, to the ende I maye returne vnto you more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued.
<pb facs="tcp:19820:206"/> Wherfore I pray thée, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that thou prepare thy ſelfe to fight with them valiantly by the ſword of the word of God, and that we may ſee the ende of that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and alſo of the <hi>Limbe,</hi> whereof the matter hath bene broken off, &amp; hath not ben followed nor reſolued. Yet neuertheleſſe this is one pointe, the which I deſire almoſte aſmuch the reſolution, as of the Purgatory. And to the end you may haue the more leaſure to debate of the matter, I will hold you no longer. But bicauſe that it is now ſo late, therfore me thinketh that it ſhalbe better to take the time at our pleaſure.</p>

But I, whiche am but a poore ideot and very ignoraunt, what ought I to thinke, and whereto ought I to ſtaye my ſelfe, when I conſider the diuerſitie of opinions whiche is amonge men, touchinge the religyon, and namely touching the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the dead, and of the infernall and celeſtiall regy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and habitations, yea, amongeſt the moſte ſage and wiſeſt? As I haue proued in theſe dayes amonge your ſelues, who are of as contrarye a ſentence the one from the other, as the fire and the water. Therefore haue I taken in hande the voiage of Sainct <hi>Petricke,</hi> in which <note place="margin">S.

Yet neuertheleſſe, ſithence that I haue beard theſe matters debated more amply and cléerely and better declared, then euer I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I haue very much loſt my fantaſie.

For Theologians do affirme that there is two ſortes of <note place="margin">Poena damni. &amp; poena ſenſus Leo de viim. ſer uim ſeſt. mort.</note> paines in Purgatory, to wit, the paine of <hi>Dam,</hi> and the paine of the ſence. By the payne of <hi>Dam,</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19820:231"/> the dammage and hurt that the ſoules doe receiue for the long tarying and let that they haue, to ſée the face of God, and to bée in poſſeſſion of the ioyes of Paradiſe. By the paine of the ſence, they vnderſtand the tormentes which the ſoules doe féele of the fire by the which they are puniſhed. Now iudge, what difference can be. Firſt, what more greater paine can the dampned haue then this héere? Sith that your Doctors do affirme that the fire of <note place="margin"> 
                              <hi>Io. Maio. 4. ſent diſt. 44. q.</hi> 1.</note> hell, and of Purgatory, is all one, as to his ſubſtaunce, and that after the daye of the laſt iudgement, Purgatorye ſhall bee mingled with Hell, and they ſhalbe but one ſelfe thing? Thou canſt not heere finde any other difference, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that Purgatorye is not a perpetuall hell, neyther an eternall hell fire, but that it hath a certeine ende: and that the <hi>Limbe</hi> is a halfe Hell. For there is but the paine of <hi>Dam,</hi> ſith that there is no fire. The which yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe your Doctors ds affirme to be ſo great that it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all the paines of the world. And for to proue it, they alledge Sainct <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying. To be an eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the kingdome of God, depriued from the ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, is a paine ſo great, that ther are no torments that may be compared vnto them. And <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith: Many are afrayde of the Bell fire, but I eſtéeme a paine a great deale greater then the hell fire, tha fall from that glorye. Thou doeſt then ſee, whether I doe wronge to call the <hi>Limbe,</hi> Hell. But ther is yet a difference betwéene <note place="margin">Barl. ſerm. de poen. infer.</note> the paines of the auncient fathers, which were deteyned and kept in the <hi>Limbe,</hi> and the children that are borne dead. For that halfe hell, after your doctrine, is vnto them eternall: the which it was not vnto the auncient fathers. But the better to declare and ſhewe foorth that matter. I <note place="margin">Abrahams boſme. Luc. 16. c. 12</note> demaund of thée what thou thinckeſt the boſome of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to be, in which Lazarus reſted?

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19820:240"/> is really in the hoaſt, and that wée muſt there eate hys fleſh and drinke his bloude, after the manner as they haue taught vs. It ſhall not be then no leſſe neceſſary to keepe the conſecrated hoaſtes, and of the Gods in the boxe, for to communicate to the little children, &amp; to giue vnto them the Sacrament of the Euchariſte, as the ſame of baptiſme. For the wordes of Ieſus Chriſt doe vrge no leſſe in the one of the places then in the other. And if thou doo thinke, that there is great difference; I wil ſhew vnto thée eaſely, that many among the auncients, haue perceiued &amp; iudged it to be ſo as I ſay: or otherwiſe, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Charlemaine they woulde not haue kept the Euchariſtia, for to giue it vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> little children, when they were ſicke, if they had not eſteemed the thing very neceſſary. Yet neuertheleſſe it is written in the booke of Anſegiſus, Abbot of Liege, that the <note place="margin">Anſegiſus.</note> ſame was done in that time there, and reciteth the canon which was made.

Thoſe worthy men would not haue ſo much attributed vnto the Sacraments, if they had not ſo much taken to the rigor and to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words of Ieſus Chriſt.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19820:241"/> are equiualent manners of ſpeakings: And the two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Ieſus Chriſt, are equipolent y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one to the other: &amp; ther is none other difference, ſauing that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> laſt is more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and expoundeth the firſt. For ſith that our firſt natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is carnal, it muſt be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſecond be ſpirituall. Sith that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. f. 47</note> the firſt man is of the earth earthly, it is requiſite, that the ſecond, which is from heauen, be heauenly and ſpirituall. Now that regeneration &amp; tranſformation cannot be made, but by the ſpirite of God. For as it is written in that ſame place: That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh. That that <note place="margin">Iohn. 3. a. 6.</note> is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit. And therefore Ieſus Chriſt willing to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto Nicodemus y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Except y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a man be borne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue or a new, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the kingdome of God: Afterwardes ſaith: which ſhall not bée borne of water and the holy Ghoſt: bicauſe that the holy Ghoſt, author of that regeneration, is giuen from aboue: which worketh a ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d natiuitie in vs, which is celeſtiall and ſpirituall.</p>

                        <p>Thy expoſition doth pleaſe me very much. Wherefore if thou makeſt it no difficultie, to take in that place the fire, for the ſpirit of God &amp; for more ample expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his nature &amp; properties, wherfore ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou to make a doubt to take y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> water in that place for that ſame ſignification, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> agréeing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the water hath with the nature of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy Ghoſt? For there is no leſſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but a great deale more appearance. For Sainct Iohn putteth the holy Ghoſt firſt, &amp; the fire afterwards. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſéemeth, either that he vnderſtandeth two thinges ſeperated: or that he expoundeth the thing more cléere, by a more darker thing: Although that thy aunſwere doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatiſfye that obiection. But in that place Ieſus Chriſt putteth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> water firſt: &amp; afterwards, as if hée would <note place="margin">Holy Ghoſt vvater</note> expound his Metaphore and compariſon, and giue vnto it more greater brightneſſe, he declareth what he would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie by that water: to wit, the holy Ghoſt: vnto whom he giueth that name for many cauſes. Firſt, bicauſe that as the fire is an element meruailous pure and cleane, and ſo neceſſary vnto mans life, that it is impoſſible for men to lack it, ſo is it of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> water: the which is alſo by nature cléere, pure and cleane and very proper for to repreſent the ſame of the holy Ghoſt. For it waſheth, purifieth, cleanſeth and refreſheth the hearts and conſciences, for to comfort them, and to make them bring foorth fruite pleaſing vnto God: in ſuch ſort that the water cauſeth the earth to fructifie &amp; renoweth and maketh it fertile, &amp; waſheth away the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Heb. 6. b. 7</note> from the body. It quencheth and putteth out in lyke manner the fire and heate of wicked carnall concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the water quencheth out the fire: and que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cheth the thirſt and alteration of the poore féebled ſoules, &amp; refreſheth them for euer. The ſeconde cauſe is, that hée would haue opened vnto vs the intelligence and vnderſtanding of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, baptiſmes and purifycations conteyned in the law of Moſes &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prophets in like manner, by which the holy ghoſt was promiſed, chiefly by Eſay &amp; Ezechiel: vnto <note place="margin">Eſa. 44. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The which Sainct Peter witneſſeth to haue bene <note place="margin">Act. 2. 2. 1</note> accompliſhed both in him and in the other Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, the day of Pentecoſt, according to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Ioel. And therefore Ieſus Chriſt, would as well in <note place="margin">Ioel. 2. g. 29</note> that place, as in ſpeaking vnto the Samaritane, and bidding thoſe which were in the temple to come drinke of thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. b. 14 &amp; 7. f. 38</note> waters, vſe thoſe manners of ſpeakings: And for to declare vnto vs in like manner, to what ende he hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the ſigne of the water, in the baptiſme. And that it is true, I doe take Sainct Iohn for a witneſſe: who expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the words of his Maſter, ſaith: that he vnderſtandeth by thoſe waters, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy Ghoſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which the beléeuers ought to receiue. Thirdly, by that forme of figured ſpeaking, be teacheth vs in like manner, what the Chriſtian man ought to bée, that is, regenerated by the holy Ghoſt, ſetting foorth the water and the winde, which are bodyes more ſubtill, thinner, cléerer, &amp; purer then the earth, which is an eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more weightier, vnpurer, thicker and materyall. Theſe wordes then doe ſignifie as much as if hée had ſayde, that in ſtéede of that weightie, earthlye, carnall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, wée muſt be regenerated into a newe man, heauenlye, ſpirituall and perfect: as much differing from this héere whiche is earthly and fallinge, as the water and the winde doe differ from the earth: And it muſt be that the ſame is done by the holy Ghoſt which is the true water, which maketh that purification in vs.</p>

For although that I would receiue the expoſition of Chriſoſtome, it followeth not therefore, that by the ſame one may conclude, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the water to be ſo neceſſary vnto ſaluation, that without the ſame, man cannot obteine it. For wée muſt conſider, that when the ſcripture &amp; the auncient Doctors do ſpeake of the ſacraments, they haue not regarde onely <note place="margin">The ſtile of the ſcripture &amp; of the auncient Doctors tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> to the outward ſigne, but do ſtaye themſelues principally vpon the thing ſignified by them, the which they doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand properly. And therefore following their intelly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, we may expounde thoſe wordes after that ſence, as if Ieſus Chriſt did ſay: hée which ſhall not waſh away his ſinnes, which ſhall not receiue truely the holy Ghoſt, and which ſhall not be receiued into my Church, and into my flocke, after the manner as I haue ordeyned that hée ſhoulde doe by the baptiſme, ſhall not enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. It followeth not therefore, that he which ſhall haue héere all the thinges compriſed and ſignified by the baptiſme, ought to bée reiected and forſaken of God, if he lacke but the water. But yet the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thée, I will declare vnto thée euidently, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the auncient Doctors, but alſo the ſcholaſticalles and queſtionaries, doe confirme my ſentence.

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, I conſider that in that time there was no mention made of Purgatorye. Wherefore if wée muſt praye for the dead, it is moſt lykeſt, that the prayer ſhould haue bene ordeyned to that ende that they ſhoulde be deliuered from the <hi>Lymbes,</hi> if there had bene any, then from the paines <note place="margin">Prayers for the reſurrection</note> of Purgatory: or for the comming of Ieſus Chriſt and the reſurrection of the fleſh. But I doe not finde in all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, as well of the olde as of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that euer the Patriarches, Prophetes and Apoſtles, haue inſtituted or ordeyned, that one ſhoulde make anye ſpeciall or perticuler prayers, for the dead, neither for to drawe them from the <hi>Lymbes</hi> nor from Purgatorye, nor for the reſurrection of their bodyes. I will not denye, but that the holy Fathers haue greatly deſired the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, and but that according to their deſire they haue made earneſt prayers and requeſtes vnto God, euen as we doe praye dayly, that Gods kingdome may come, deſiringe generally, all that which apperteineth to the fulfilling of the ſame.

As touchinge my voyage, I am come backe agayne. I haue ſéene that which I deſired to knowe. I thincke that Euſebius is as much preſſed and ouercome as I, and that hee hath no more greater har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys nor weapons for to defend his Purgatorye nor his Lymbes, Euſebius. It is moſt certeine that I haue my ſpirit much troubled with ſo many matters, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe. But neuertheleſſe I haue not yet all diſployed and ſhewed foorth my argumentes &amp; reaſons. You haue nowe robbed me of the place whiche I haue propounded vnto you of the booke of the Machabees, vnder the tytle that it was Apocripha: But thoſe that I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto you now, ſhalbée taken out of bookes ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentickes and Canonicall, that you can by no meanes reiect them. And if you can ſhewe by euydent reaſons, that I dooe not alledge them to the purpoſe, and that they do ſerue mée nothing at all for to proue my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will confeſſe my ſelfe vanquiſhed, and wyll giue you my hand for to be of your ſide.</p>

                     <p>IN this latter dialogue Euſebius putteth foorth the places of the holy ſcripture, the which they alleadge commonly for the defence and confirmation of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: to the which Theophilus anſwereth, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them after the true ſence of the ſcripture: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth the falſe interpretacions of the Sophiſters: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth many good pointes and places of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Afterwards ſhalbe touched the opinion of them which thinke that there ſhalbe preaching in the other worlde: And a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſt to ſaluation, for ſuch as haue not knowen him in this world. VVherevpon ſhalbe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place of Saint Peter, touching the preaching of Ieſus Chriſt vnto the deade, &amp; to the ſpirits that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in priſon: &amp; for the end &amp; concluſion of all thoſe matters, the funeralles of purgatory ſhall be celebrated, and he ſhalbe buried.

                        <p>Very well, following the interpretacion of Eccius, which expoundeth it of the Almoſes for to refreſh <note place="margin">The expoſition of the place of Thoby.</note> the poore, that they ſhould pray vnto God for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deade.</p>

In the booke of Thoby, &amp; in that place there, there is no mention made of praying for the dead. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe words preceded thervnto, he ought rather to haue ſaide: Set thy breade vppon the buriall of the ſinner, then vpon that of the righteous. For the ſinners ſhal haue more neede of ſuch prayers, then the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But he ſaith altogether contrarye. For hée addeth: eate and drinke not with the ſinners and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: The which is better expreſſed by the Greeke, ſaying:
<pb facs="tcp:19820:272"/> Set thy breade vpon the buriall of the righteous, and giue it not vnto ſinners. Wherefore it is moſt likeſt to be true, ſith that before he hath ſpoken of Almoſes, that he recommendeth by thoſe wordes, chiefely the righteous and faithfull, euen as ſaint Paul, aboue all other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth thoſe of the houſhold of faith.

                           </note> in burying them honeſtly, as Thoby did, without ſparing that which was there vnto néedefull and requiſite. For the Hebrewes by the breade, wyne and water, doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande all the things neceſſarie vnto man, and vnto mans life. The other is, when we doe helpe our bretheren, &amp; ſuccour ſo their neceſſities: that they dye not for want of vittailes, nor goe downe to the graue without being buried.

Then we ſhed foorth our breade and wine vpon their burialles, behold the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water that they deſire. And it is a great deale better to doe after that ſort, then to playe the glutton with the gluttons, drunkerds and wicked. But the manner of ſpech is ſomewhat obſcure, bicauſe that the booke, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was written in Greeke, yet neuertheleſſe it keepeth the phraſes and manners of the Hebrew ſpeach.</p>

If we find that it is commaunded of God and compriſed in the holy ſcriptures, we may and ought boldely to propounde and affirme it. On the contrary, if the Scripture doth make no mention of it, it is not lawfull onely to open the mouth, for to ſpeake one word, and for to propounde for certeine a thing vncerteine. For curſed is the man, which putteth foorth for a ſure doctrine, a thing, of which he himſelfe is not certein, and of which he cannot ſay with the Prophet and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Pſal. 116, b. 11 2.

For wée ought to beware and kéepe our ſelues, as from death, to teach vnto others, to beléeue and to do that, which we our ſelues beléeue not, and of which we are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine. Now it is impoſſible to be aſſured and certeine of ſuch things, then by the word of god the which we ought to follow in all things. But I ſée cleane contrary in thoſe which haue taught mens traditions, in ſtéede of the worde of God.

And therefore they doe all their endeuours, for to finde in the Scripture ſome coulour, for to beautifie and ſhew foorth their worke: And there is nothing, ſo that it hath any appearaunce at all, but that they drawe it violently, depraue and marre it, for to make it ſerue to their purpoſe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19820:281"/> There is then ſome which is pardoned in the worlde to come: the which cannot be but in Purgatory. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a Purgatory. There is not a Sophiſter ſo ignoraunt, which ought not to knowe, that according to the rules of their Logicke, one cannot draw a conſequence whatſoeuer it be, of propoſitions altogether negatiues.

Now Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh héere of ſinne which dampneth, the which agreeth not but to the reprobate. Wherefore he ſpeaketh of the faulte of ſinne, the which is not pardoned in Purgatory, according to your doctrine, for in the ſame one can but releaſe the payne.</p>
                        <p>It followeth then, that although that we doe agrée and graunt vnto you that ther is ſome forgiuenſſe of ſinne in the other worlde, euen as you woulde conclude of the words of Ieſus Chriſt that the ſame ſhould nothing at all relieue and helpe vp your Purgatory. Wée muſt then <note place="margin">Sinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.</note> conſider the manner of ſpeaking, by the which Ieſus Chriſt woulde declare, how greate and deteſtable that ſinne is, and to take away all the hope of pardon, vnto thoſe which in that poynt will reſiſt the truth knowen, and will goe about to quenche and putte out the lyght of the holy Ghoſt, which is offered vnto them.</p>
                        <p>And therefore hée was not contented to ſay: that ſinne ſhall neuer be forgiuen and pardoned. But the better for to augment and amplyfie the thing, hée woulde vſe that manner of ſpeaking, which comprehendeth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the which already euery man féeleth in his conſcience in this lyfe: and that latter iudgement which ſhall be manifeſted in the reſurrection.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore hee ſayth briefely, that in this ſame lyfe, in the which God hath giuen to man, time and ſpace to conuert and tourne himſelfe vnto him, that ſinne ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be pardoned, and yet leſſe in that latter iudgement, in which God will giue his latter ſentence: except peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there were ſome, which in him had ſome hope.</p>
                        <p>But it followeth not thererefore that he hath forgiueneſſe of any ſinne, in the worlde to come, which ſhall not bée héere pardoned.

But although it ſhould be ſo, that there ſhould be in the world to come ſome forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, it followeth not therefore, that it is neceſſary to haue there a Purgatory.

                        <p>Thou haſt moued a queſtion, the whiche cannot be expreſſed and abſolued in few wordes. For we muſt firſt declare what knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vnto ſaluation: and how it hath bene alwayes prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the beginning of the world, among all people &amp; nations: And how it hath ben ſufficiently manifeſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the elect for their ſaluation, &amp; to the reprobate for their condempnation: Inſomuch that they are all inexcuſable, &amp; they cannot alledge ignorance ſufficient for to excuſe them: And it is not néedfull that they haue any more preaching after this lyfe. But I had rather that we would omit and leaue off that matter vntill an other time, that we maye ſpeake more amply of it, and better to ſatiſfie the queſtion which is made dayly, touching the ſaluation or dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our predeceſſors, which haue liued in errour and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce.

                        <p>I vnderſtand what thou wouldeſt ſay. The pope hath heaped vp together all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merits of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, of the patriarchs, prophets, Apos;tles, Martirs, confeſſors, virgins, ſaints &amp; ſaintes of paradiſe, &amp; of al the Chriſtian Church in a treaſure, and a garner of which he alone hath the keyes and can open or ſhut, &amp; diſtribute lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or much, when he will and as it pleaſeth him. <note place="margin">The great Lockyer or lockſmyth.</note> For he is the great lockeſimth. But al the others are but as his ſeruaunts, of whom he lymitteth the power and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of euery one, in ſuch ſort, that they cannot diſtribute, but that that he hath delyuered vnto them, and of whom they haue the keyes. Wherefore if it behoueth that hée
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19820:295"/> haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſury &amp; garner a great many of ſeuerall cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and cabins, of which many muſt haue the keyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one his owne, for to depart and beſtow that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off he hath the diſpenſation, without daring to touche the reſt, except that ſometimes, thoſe lyttle varlets and locke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmithes doe picke the locke and the dore of the great lok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith <note place="margin">Picke lockes.</note> and great treaſurer, he knowing nothing thereoff, and that he be not therewithall content: although that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his name and title, they ſtreth foorth their power, as ſéemeth good vnto them, and doe forge keyes, bulles and pardons as many as they lyſt, and alwaies at the coſts of the poore people. Now the great lockeſmith hath no lymit, but that he hath alwaies reaſonable cauſe, for to giue buls and pardons as many as one woulde, ſo that money doe come: or otherwiſe he will ſuffer the poore ſoules to be roſted and tormented in Purgatory, as long as the world ſhall continue, for want of one leafe of paper or parchment with a lyttle waxe and leade. As concerning the others which haue the daies limitted that they may giue pardons, I haue a certeine doubt, the which I would y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of it by thée Euſebius. For ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one hath power to giue two or thrée thouſand, an other two or thrée hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, an other an hundreth fiftie, fortie, thirtie or twentie, either more or leſſe. I would gladly know of thée what <note place="margin">Clockes of Purgatory.</note> horologes &amp; clocks, &amp; what quadrans they haue in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for to meaſure thoſe dayes there. For ſith that there is no ſun, moone nor ſtars, what daies &amp; what yeres can they haue? For the time is taken of the morning, of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne. But thoſe which are in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, haue nothing of al this: Wherfore I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what yeres, what months, dayes &amp; houres they can haue: &amp; whether they be very long or ſhort. <note place="margin">Example of the long dayes in Purgatory.</note> As far as I can imagine, by an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple which <hi>Antonius Florentin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth in his ſum, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies ought ther to be meruailous lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.

For at the verye ſame daye which was preſcribed vnto him, the Pope dyed of a ſodeyne death, and departed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinely for to goe and aunſwere there. What ſayeſt thou by this <hi>Euſebius?</hi> If this hiſtory be falſe, it is a great diſhonor for the Cardeliers, who do make great accompt of that booke, and doe holde it to be very pretious among them, as a relicke, and reuelation. And for the Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which hath confirmed the order of ſaint Fraunces, and of the foure <hi>Mendicants.</hi> I know not what good meanes we may héere finde for to maynteine that buylding, and <note place="margin">The foundacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the order of the Mendica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> the honour and authoritie both of the one and of the other. For ſith that the Pope hath confirmed the order of Saint Fraunces, the order of ſaint Fraunces is buylded and ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vppon the Pope, wherefore when the Pope ſhall fall, which is the ſtone and foundation of that Church and of that buylding, alſo ſhall fall the buylding, the order and the rule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

But I conſider onely, that ſith that the Cordeliers haue written ſuch an hiſtory, &amp; do maynteine it by their bookes, that they doe abate aſmuch the authoritie and power of the Pope, as the Pope doth confirme their rule and order. For how can this witneſſe agrée, with this propoſition? The Pope cannot erre? And with the expoſition which <hi>Eccius</hi> and his lyke doe make of thoſe words?

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19820:298"/> ſome. But it followeth not therefore, but that all men are conſtrained to cary it, and but that it is a burthen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to all men.

                        <p>I am aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ignorance of ſuch interpreters of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For firſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the acts, it is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke copies the ſorrowes of hel, and it was not ſo written of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> For he hath ſayd, the ſorrowes of death, and not of hell: although that in your common tranſlation it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as thou ſayeſt. But although it were ſo, all ſhoulde come to one ende. For the text doth plainely declare, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh in that Sermon of the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, and that hée himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth hell, for the tribulations, extreme ſorrowes, the death, the pit, the ſepulchre, the low places, and the eſtate and condition of the dead, from which Ieſus Chriſt is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. He maketh there no mencion of the <hi>Limbe,</hi> of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, nor of the gehenne or hell fire. That ſame ſolution ſufficeth for all the other places by thée alledged. For that is very common in the Scripture, to take hell in that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, as it appeareth by thoſe places the which thou baſt put foorth. For how many times ſaith the Prophet in thoſe ſame places? The ſighings of the dead haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed me. I haue called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée in my trouble.

                        <p>Thou oughteſt alreadye to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded by that which hath bene ſayde of that place, that it can ſerue nothing at all for Purgatory. I doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye vnto thée, but that in the time of the Apoſtles, there were ſuffrages and prayers for the dead. But that was among the Panims and Idolaters, as it hath bene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very amply entreated off amongeſt vs. And doubte not, but that there remayneth ſome roote of ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in ſome of thoſe which are called Chriſtians. But if it were ſo as thou doeſt vnderſtande it, it followeth not therefore that Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth that manner of dooing: As the auncient Doctors themſelues dooe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it, namely Sainct <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> For I may well take <note place="margin">Ambro. in 1. Cor. 15.</note> an argument againſt a Papiſt (which will denye vnto mée the reſurrection, or immortalitie of the ſoules) with their manner of dooings towardes the dead, for to beate him with his owne ſwoorde, and yet I will not allow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe their ſuperſtition. But it is not néedfull to ſtay any more vpon that place, ſith that I haue already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thée, howe the auncientes haue vnderſtanded it, and howe it is alſo expounded by others. For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer expoſition that thou maiſt giue vnto it, it cannot ſerue for thy purpoſe. And there was neuer any of the auncientes, which hath dreamed, that the ſame was done bicauſe of Purgatorye. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witneſſeth, <note place="margin">Epipha. li. 1 Tom. 2. hereſ. 18.</note> that thoſe which baptiſed themſelues for the dead, which were dead before that they had receiued Baptiſme, did it to that ende that when they ſhoulde riſe againe in the reſurrection, they ſhoulde not bée puniſhed for that they haue not bene baptiſed in this worlde. He ſayth that ſuch was their opinion. Wherefore it is eaſily to knowe, that they did not thinke of Purgatory.</p>
                        <p>Hée toucheth yet an other expoſition of that place, the which hée alloweth. But yet it maketh leſſe for thée. To conclude, that place ſerueth as much for your broylers of ſoules for to proue your Purgatory, as for the <hi>Marcioniſtes</hi> heretickes, who as witneſſeth <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactus,</hi>
